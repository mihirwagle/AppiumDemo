#Getting started with **APPIUM**

##Use
Since running the same tests manually on every device can be exhausting and hence impractical, developers tend to prefer to write tests for their code, which will be automatically executed.
This practice is referred to as automated testing.
**APPIUM** is an HTTP server which helps us do the same using WebDriver.
Since it is an HTTP server and since most languages have support for HTTP, we also have freedom as to which language to use.
Any **CORDOVA** project, generating native code for both iOS and android can be tested this way, using the *same* tests, even though the platform is different.
To better understand the usage and the scope of **APPIUM** alongside the workflow to be adopted, please watch the following youtube video.
